Hi, I'm stupidguy -- for now. In many years, if I reach fluency in Japanese, I'll graduate from being stupidguy.

I'm new to git-related things and only know basics for a bunch of stuff like C++, bash, Linux, CSS, emacs, vim, Anki, etc.  
Learning and staying up to date are my goals in being here.  
I'm not a professional in this domain of knowledge, so I won't be contributing much of importance.

I have no plans to be great at any programming languages at the moment.  
For now, I'll be learning whatever I think will help me most with customization of apps, parsing of data, automating tasks, etc.
